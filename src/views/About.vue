        <p class="about-subtitle">Studies: </p>
        <p class="about-text">I'm a 2nd year computer science student who has a passion for technology. 
            I chose to pursue software engineering as my degree discipline after I discovered that games development wasn't entirely my thing. 
            Gaming is a big hobby of mine and growing up I have always wanted to make games. 
            In college I took both a computer science course and a games course.
            I took computer science as it complimented my love for maths well, and after taking IT in secondary school I wanted to learn more.
            Despite a lot of the computer science course being theory, it intruiged me greatly and quickly superseded my interest for games.</p>

        <p class="about-text">After discovering the enjoyment I found in C# programming, I wanted to learn more about designing and developing software that is used daily. 
            Through my course, I am hoping to learn how software is designed, planned and developed so that I can improve my skills in both practical and theoretical programming. 
            I understand that a lot of software engineering focuses purely on design rather than code. 
            I wish to learn both well, then follow in the more development path so I can continue coding.</p>

        <p class="about-text">As part of my University course, I will take part in a year of placement in which I will work within a company desiging and developing real world systems. 
            I am excited to see what perspective this year in placement will give me as I have yet to do any programming within a team, outside of a couple game jams.</p>
        <p class="about-subtitle">Hobbies: </p>

        <p class="about-text">Other than programming, I enjoy playing video games within my spare time either alone or with friends.
            I also enjoy going out on walks, bike riding, hiking and taking part in the occasional run at local parkruns with my parents.
            When my friends are available and willing, I also enjoy playing various sports like football, tennis and badminton.
            I wouldn't call it a hobby but I have always enjoyed maths during school and sometimes find myself wanting to go back to some A level maths concepts for fun.
